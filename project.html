                    <p class="text-justify">The primary aim of the action is to investigate how new macroprudential policies can influence financial stability without contributing to the inequality in a society. In this project, we will apply cutting-edge, agent-based simulation techniques to uncover the redistributive effects of macroprudential policies and to examine the optimal combinations of the macroprudential tools from the social welfare perspective. The results of this project will complement the conclusions that have been extracted from the ECB system-wide stress-testing exercises by providing data on the rise of inequality in EU countries due to the adoption of new financial regulations. It will also supplement the macroeconomic impact assessment for the Basel III reforms (cost-benefit “Growth-at-Risk” approach).</p>
                    <p class="text-justify mt-4">This project will also expand our knowledge about an innovative tool, namely, agent-based modelling, which can be used in financial oversight. It will provide us with the practical knowledge of how to take the heterogeneity of the agents in the models into account and how to apply the new Bayesian estimation techniques. The results of the project could guide policymakers and central bankers on how to reshape financial regulations and to calibrate macroprudential policies in order to minimise adverse social effects and to reduce inequality (by supporting a social policy). The project is consistent with the European Commission’s support on research programmes on the public sector and social innovation that is described in the Europe 2020 Flagship Initiative Innovation Union.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify mt-4">The researcher will be fully integrated into Prof. J. Doyne Farmer’s Complexity Economics team at the INET Oxford and at the Mathematical Institute of the University of Oxford. The fellowship will give the applicant the opportunity to perform relevant and state-of-the art research in the best institute of complexity economics in the world, to strengthen her position as an independent research group leader and to initiate new long-term collaborations.</p>

                                    <li>(WP4) Second, econometric analyses will be performed to identify the channels through which different macroprudential instruments affect the level of inequality in selected EU countries (the econometric methods address concerns about endogeneity and reverse causality).

The MSCA fellow has been integrated in the Complexity Economics Group at the INET Oxford. Her participation in group meetings will enable her to improve her knowledge and skills. The researcher's contribution to the creation of the agent-based macro models and macroprudential policies was also important for the group's research. The Fellowship will also be a remarkable opportunity for her to develop excellent international networking opportunities and to improve her career development possibilities.  The training will be focused on improving the fellow’s research, management and communication skills. For more info see the CV in the section <span class="italic">About me</span>.</p>

                                <p class="mt-4 text-justify">The general policy at the University of Oxford is to promote “new economic thinking” and free access to knowledge and groundbreaking scientific research, either by making new techniques available or by assuring open access to all publications. Therefore, in order to communicate the research results, the fellow will either publish papers in open access scientific journals or place them on preprint servers (such as arxiv) in order to maximise their availability. The simulation results will be available for download on the INET Oxford webpage. In order to share the project’s results with the research community, the applicant will present her findings at international conferences, which will increase their public visibility. A series of short visits will be undertaken to give seminar talks and to build collaborations with risk and complexity science research groups around the world.

For this purpose, she has developed a strategy based on building a project website “Monetarist in Heels”, which contains links to YouTube videos and posts on Facebook, LinkedIn and ResearchGate.  The distribution of information about the project was started by advertising it through people who are potentially interested in the subject (on Facebook and LinkedIn). While Facebook and YouTube will permit the project activities to be communicated to a younger audience, the use of LinkedIn will draw the attention of the multipliers among professionals and members of the EU financial oversight institutions.</p>
                                <p class="mt-4 text-justify">Articles were also published in the press.  In addition, the fellow participated in the European Researchers’ Night, where she explained the results of her project to the public so that non-specialists can understand it.

                                <p class="mt-4 text-justify">The public engagement activities will contribute to creating an awareness of the performed research by informing and inspiring the public, by listening to public views and by collaborating with the public.

                    <p>There are clear scientific, methodological and socio-economic reasons for conducting the MACROPRU project. It is consistent with the attempts to underpin a social market economy within the “Europe 2020” Strategy, as well as with the European Commission’s support on research programmes on the public sector and social innovation.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4">The results of the project might guide policy makers and central bankers on how to reshape financial regulations and calibrate macroprudential policies in order to minimise the adverse social effects and to reduce inequality (by supporting social policy). The project will expand our scientific knowledge about a new innovative tool that can be used in financial stability oversight, namely agent-based modelling.</p>
